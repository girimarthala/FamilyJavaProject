In this Maven java project, I have added a main class that will class two other classes.
I have also added unit tests for those classes.

To execute the main class
run mvn package exec:java
This will return the results as
Girish
Add Numbers:30

These are the two print statements that I have added in my main class.

Commands to clean, compile, run tests and then create a jar
1. mvn clean - Cleans the prooject, removes jars.
2. mvn compile - Compiles the project and create a target directory with the class files.
3. mvn test-compile - Compiles the test directory and creates a tes-classes directory under target with class files for the tests.
4. mvn test - Runs the unit tests.
5. mvn install - Creates a jar for the project in target directory.
